I work at the intersection of AI research, social science, and tech development. My focus is twofold: measuring and understanding AI's social impacts, and developing technology that genuinely serves human needs and enhances human capabilities. Technology, and AI in particular, is shaping how societies develop. My work ensures these systems are designed with clarity about their impact on individuals and communities, creating solutions that are both technically robust and socially meaningful.

Currently pursuing my PhD in Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence at the [Center for Human-Inspired AI (CHIA)](https://www.chia.cam.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge, part of the Trace Lab, supervised by [Dr. Umang Bhatt](https://umangsbhatt.github.io) and co-supervised by [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/). I have a particular interest in the cognitive and social impacts of AI adoption and how culture shapes them, with current research focused on the externalities of human-AI interaction—tracking how AI use influences productivity, confidence, equity, and moral reasoning at scale. My background in Sociology (Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador) and Data Science (University of Edinburgh) enables me to bridge the gap between disciplines, understanding social dynamics and human behavior, and then designing computational systems that respond to these realities.
