Bridging social science and technology to create AI with humanity in mind.

I work at the intersection of AI research, social science, and tech development. My focus is twofold: measuring and understanding AI's social impacts, and developing technology that genuinely serves human needs and enhances human capabilities.

Currently pursuing my PhD in Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence at the Center for Human-Inspired AI (CHIA) at the University of Cambridge, I'm part of the Trace Lab, supervised by Umang Bhatt and co-supervised by Anna Korhonen. I have a particular interest in how culture shapes AI adoption and its cognitive and social impacts, looking to develop AI tools as thought partners—systems that amplify human agency rather than replace it. My background in sociology (Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador) and data science (University of Edinburgh) allows me to translate between disciplines: understanding social dynamics and human behavior, then designing computational systems that respond to those realities.

Technology, and AI in particular, is shaping how societies develop. My work ensures these systems are designed with clarity about their impact on individuals and communities, creating solutions that are both technically robust and socially meaningful.
